## Privacy Policy for TimeToDo

**Last Updated:** May 30, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how TimeToDo ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our service. TimeToDo is a service that connects your Todoist account with your Rebble timeline, allowing you to push your Todoist tasks as pins to your Rebble device.

We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This policy outlines our practices and aims to be clear and transparent.

**1. Information We Collect**

To provide the TimeToDo service, we collect and store the following information:

* **Rebble Timeline Token:** This token is required to authenticate and authorize TimeToDo to push pins to your Rebble timeline.
* **Rebble Account Token:** This token is used to interact with your Rebble account as necessary for the service's functionality.
* **Todoist Access Token:** This token allows TimeToDo to access your Todoist tasks and project information on your behalf. This token is necessary to read your tasks and create pins.
* **Todoist User ID:** This identifier helps us associate your Todoist account with your TimeToDo service configuration.
* **Timezone:** We store your timezone (e.g., "America/Phoenix") to ensure that pins are scheduled and displayed accurately according to your local time.

**2. How We Use Your Information**

The information we collect is used exclusively for the following purposes:

* **To Provide and Maintain the Service:** Your Rebble tokens are used to push pins to your Rebble timeline. Your Todoist access token and user ID are used to retrieve your tasks from Todoist and process them according to your service settings. Your timezone information ensures the timely delivery of these pins.
* **To Respond to Service Requests:** We may use your information to identify your account and provide support if you encounter issues with the service.
* **To Maintain Service Integrity:** We may use service logs, which can include access times and actions taken, to monitor the health of our service, troubleshoot issues, and prevent abuse.

**3. How We Store and Secure Your Information**

We take the security of your information seriously and implement measures to protect it:

* **Encryption:** Your Todoist access token and Rebble timeline token are encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption.
* **Infrastructure:** TimeToDo is hosted on Google Cloud Run, and all data, including the encrypted tokens and other collected information, is stored in Google Firestore databases located in the United States.
* **Access Controls:** We implement strict access controls to limit who can access your information.

**4. Information Sharing and Disclosure**

We share your information only with the third-party services that are essential for TimeToDo to function, and only for the reasons described below:

* **Todoist:**
    * **Why:** To access your tasks and project information. TimeToDo utilizes Todoist webhooks to receive updates about your tasks in real-time. We also use the Todoist API (authenticated by your access token) to retrieve task details.
    * **Information Shared:** Your Todoist access token is used to interact with the Todoist API. Task data is processed by our service as directed by your use of TimeToDo.
* **Rebble:**
    * **Why:** To push pins to your Rebble timeline.
    * **Information Shared:** Your Rebble Timeline Token and Rebble Account Token are used to authenticate with the Rebble services and deliver pins to your timeline. The content of your Todoist tasks, as configured by you, will be sent to Rebble to create these pins.

We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information with any other third parties for marketing or other purposes.

**5. Analytics and Tracking**

TimeToDo does not use any third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics) and does not collect any analytics data. We only maintain service logs for operational and security purposes. These logs do not track your activity across other websites or services.

**6. Data Retention**

We will retain your information as long as your TimeToDo account is active or as needed to provide you with the service. If you choose to delete your TimeToDo account or revoke our access, we will securely delete your stored tokens and associated personal information in a timely manner. Service logs may be retained for a limited period for security and operational analysis.

**7. Your Choices and Rights**

You have control over the information you provide to TimeToDo:

* **Access and Updates:** You can typically review and update your connected account information through the TimeToDo service interface.
* **Revoking Access:** You can revoke TimeToDo's access to your Todoist account through your Todoist account settings. You can also manage applications connected to your Rebble account through Rebble's settings. Revoking access will prevent TimeToDo from functioning.
